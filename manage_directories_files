Manage directories and files
Previously, you explored how to manage the file system using Linux commands. The following commands were introduced: mkdir, rmdir, touch, rm, mv, and cp. In this reading, you’ll review these commands, the nano text editor, and learn another way to write to files.
Creating and modifying directories
mkdir
The mkdir command creates a new directory. Like all of the commands presented in this reading, you can either provide the new directory as the absolute file path, which starts from the root, or as a relative file path, which starts from your current directory.
For example, if you want to create a new directory called network in your **/home/analyst/logs** directory, you can enter mkdir /home/analyst/logs/network to create this new directory. If you’re already in the /home/analyst/logs directory, you can also create this new directory by entering mkdir network.
Pro Tip: You can use the ls command to confirm the new directory was added.
